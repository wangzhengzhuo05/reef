"""OpenClaw-RL's candidate probe and its wiring to reef's RegressionGate.

The probe is the OpenClaw-RL-specific half — it scores a candidate's replies
with the benchmark's style criterion. The generic select/reject policy is
reef's ``RegressionGate`` (covered in ``test_regression_gate``). These tests pin
the probe's scoring and that ``build`` pairs it with the gate into a working
evaluate-then-decide plugin, using a fake runtime so no model is needed.
