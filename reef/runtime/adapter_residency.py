"""Runtime-global residency of scenario-owned adapters on one shared base model.

One serving engine holds one base model and a finite number of loaded LoRA
adapters. Several scenarios may each evolve an independent adapter runtime load chain on
that engine, so the capacity accounting cannot live with any single scenario:
two scenarios with private residency windows would overcommit the same slots
and evict each other's current revision. :class:`AdapterResidencyManager` is
the one accounting point for every adapter an engine holds — the training
bridge owns one per engine, and every scenario's publication, restart
recovery, and eviction goes through it.

The manager owns names, slots, and protection; the engine owns bytes. It
asks an :class:`AdapterEngine` to load or unload by name and otherwise treats
the engine as a black box: the payload it hands to ``load_adapter`` is
whatever the caller supplied (a materialized PEFT directory, a callable that
pushes trained tensors) and is never interpreted here.
