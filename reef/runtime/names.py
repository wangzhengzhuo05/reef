"""Names shared across the processes of the Reef-to-backend bridge contract.

The Reef service and a training backend run as separate processes that find
each other only by name, so these values must agree on both sides:

- ``DEFAULT_ACTOR_NAME`` / ``DEFAULT_NAMESPACE`` locate the named Ray bridge
  actor (``connect_ray_runtime`` on the Reef side, ``start_bridge`` and the
  driver healthcheck on the backend side).
- ``LATEST_JOB_MARKER_FILENAME`` is the durable training-job marker the
  backend writes next to its checkpoints and must recognize across restarts.
