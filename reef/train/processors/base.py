    Which base a recipe builds on is one question — how does its feedback
    arrive?

    * As **reports** referencing inference records → subclass
      :class:`~reef.train.processors.reported.ReportedFeedbackProcessor` and write
      ``judge`` (what counts) and ``make_batch`` (what a batch looks like).
      The engine owns everything between them — including ``ingest``, which
      is where it calls your ``judge``, on the trainer's thread: a plain
      method, so keep it a pure decision on data already in hand.
    * **Computed from the traffic itself** — correlated across records,
      judged by a model, landing asynchronously → subclass
      :class:`~reef.train.processors.computed.ComputedFeedbackProcessor` and write
      ``ingest`` (the method's own correlation, built from the engine's
      ``catch_up``/``dispatch``/``track``/``retire`` verbs), ``judge``,
      ``make_sample``, and ``make_batch``; bulky machinery stays in the
      method package. Here ``judge`` is an ``async def``: your ``ingest`` hands a
      job to ``dispatch`` and a private worker thread awaits it, so it may
      call models and take minutes without blocking serving.

    That is the whole difference between the two processors: feedback is
    either reported explicitly or computed from correlated traffic. The
    reported path calls synchronous ``judge`` inside ``ingest``; the computed
    path awaits ``async def judge`` on its worker after recipe code dispatches
    a job.

    ``DataProcessor`` itself is never a recipe's processor. Instantiated
    bare it is the no-update default: it ingests records for audit
    (retaining only their ids) but never becomes ready and never produces a
    batch. The tradeoff of folding that default into the base (rather than
    keeping it abstract with a separate ``NoUpdateProcessor``) is that a
    half-written subclass that forgets to override ``build_batch`` silently
    becomes a no-op instead of failing at construction. Recipes that go
    through :class:`WeightTrainingRecipe.build` are still guarded — it raises
    ``TypeError`` unless the recipe declares a concrete ``processor``.

    Whatever implements this contract, the trainer-facing surface stays
    synchronous: ``ingest``/``ready``/``build_batch`` run on the trainer's
    thread under its lock and must never block on network or model
    latency. Judging that calls models therefore runs on a background
    thread — the computed-feedback processor owns one, starts it on demand, exchanges
    results through thread-safe queues, and releases it in :meth:`close`,
    the teardown hook the owning scenario guarantees to call when the
    processor is dropped (dispatcher shutdown and durable reload both go
    through it). State that lives only in processor memory is rebuilt by
    replaying ingest after a restart: the trainer replays un-acknowledged
    records, so the recompute cost is bounded by the training backlog, not
    history.
