"""The recipe's candidate evaluation: contracts, built-ins, and factory loading.

Every :class:`reef.recipe.Recipe` carries a ``candidate_evaluation`` plugin —
built in code by harness recipes, or from the top-level ``evaluation`` config
section by weight recipes — and :class:`reef.train.Trainer` runs it between
prepare and settle to decide whether a produced candidate is published. The
types live here rather than under ``reef.recipe`` only because the trainer,
backends, and runtime bind to them as well.
