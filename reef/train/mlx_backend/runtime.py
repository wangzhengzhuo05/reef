"""An in-process MLX training runtime for a single Apple Silicon host.

This runtime is deliberately not a distributed system. One process holds one
base model, one LoRA adapter and one optimizer; serving and training take
turns on them, coordinated by the inference admission Reef already owns. The
honest description of the topology is: colocated, single host, single process,
synchronous.

What it is NOT: it does not generate rollouts for itself. Reef reserves a
batch of rollouts that real traffic produced and hands it here, exactly as it
does for the Slime path, so the invariant that training data always arrives
from outside the runtime holds here too.
