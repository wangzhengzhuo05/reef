"""Slime-owned step preparation: resolve a preparer signal and build the payload.

Backend-agnostic step signals (which loss family, what advantages) live in
``reef.train.algos`` and are reusable by any training backend.
The only thing left here is ``_build_payload``, which materializes Slime's
own wire tuples from a resolved signal.
