    Implement:
        ``__call__`` — given the current composition (as ``(kind, config)``
        pairs in tree order), a batch of trace samples (a sample's ``score``
        is ``None`` when the deployment batches recorded traffic without
        reports, so a method must handle unscored samples), and the
        :class:`~reef.harness.episodes.model_binding.ModelBindings` the method may
        call, return one :class:`~reef.train.cordis_backend.Mutation`, a
        sequence of them (one composite proposal, applied under one snapshot
        and settled by one selection decision), or ``None`` to skip.

    ``models`` is the only way a method reaches a model: ``models.served``
    is the model under test and ``models["name"]`` one the recipe declared
    under ``evolution.models``. ``.chat(...)`` goes to the endpoint the
    deployment configured, and the method never needs to know where that is.

    ``manifest`` is the previous step's
    :class:`~reef.train.cordis_backend.FailureManifest`, or ``None`` when
    no step has settled one yet. ``rejected`` is the recent rejected
    proposals, oldest first, each a mapping of ``step``, ``mutations``
    (``{"op", "id", "options"}`` records, the options as proposed) and the
    selector's ``reason``. ``sources`` is
    one mapping per sample, in sample order: ``record`` (the agent record
    id the sample came from), ``client`` (the ``x-reef-tag-client`` header's
    value, else the session tag, else ``untagged``) and ``untrusted``
    (always true: a sample is client text, never the operator's). Wrap sample text with
    :func:`untrusted_text` before it enters a model prompt. Each keyword is
    only forwarded to callables whose signature names it, so earlier
    proposers run unchanged.

    In ``manual`` and ``hybrid`` mode, when an instruction is queued,
    ``requests`` contains exactly one mapping with ``id``, ``text``,
    ``session``, ``release_id``, ``requires`` and ``untrusted=True``. It is the
    instruction that owns this step; ``samples`` is empty in ``manual``, and
    in ``hybrid`` it is what an automatic batch would take next, up to
    ``batch_size`` and possibly none (failing traces in the score window, or
    records under ``batch_policy: records``). The proposer must explicitly name ``requests`` to take
    instructions. It generates mutations against the current tree, then the
    same gate and publication policy used by automatic evolution apply.

    ``requires`` is what the person said the change needs from their
    machine: a list of ``{name, kind, check}`` items, ``kind`` one of
    ``permission``, ``env`` or ``service``, ``check`` optional. The mapping
    is a plain dict the method may extend: when the change it wrote needs
    something of its own (an extension that reads a variable, say), it
    adds items of the same shape to ``request["requires"]``, and the
    backend merges them by name into the commit's
    ``training_request.requires`` after the same shape and text screens
    admission runs; the person's items stand as sent, a bad item of the
    method's is dropped alone, and the mutations still stand. No check
    ever runs on the service.
