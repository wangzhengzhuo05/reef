"""Failure manifest for harness evolution steps.

Each candidate step observes how the evaluation episodes of the composition
it commits fail: which task, at which stage, and why. ``advance`` folds the
step's observations into the previous step's manifest and classes every
fingerprint as new, persisting, or fixed. The manifest travels in the
algorithm state through the commit log, so the next step's proposer reads
structured failure details instead of prose.

Causes are normalized before fingerprinting because episode errors embed
volatile absolute paths and line numbers; a fingerprint must survive a
process restart and a fresh temporary directory.
