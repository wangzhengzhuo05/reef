    """One scored rollout, tokenized for policy training.

    A sample normally represents one model call. Shared trajectory shaping may
    assemble multiple ordered calls into one sample before a training recipe
    decides whether it supports that representation.

    The first five fields are what every policy objective needs. The rest are
    optional and stay at their defaults when a method has no use for them:

    * ``action_mask`` — per response token, ``1`` for a model-generated (action)
      token and ``0`` for an environment/observation token. Methods that
      propagate advantage over actions only set it; ``loss_mask`` still
      selects which tokens receive gradient, and for a single-turn response
      the two masks are identical. Empty means "no observation boundaries
      declared".
    * ``rollout_created_at`` — wall-clock time the rollout was recorded, so a
      backend can report queue age (train time - created at). With
      ``runtime_load_id`` (the producing version, from the serving
      ``artifact_ref``) it also gives policy lag.
    * ``turn_count`` — number of ordered inference calls represented by this
      sample. Values greater than one mark a multi-turn trajectory. Reef
      records this count, but excludes it from the Slime training payload.
    * ``topk_indices`` / ``topk_log_probs`` — the generation-time top-K vocab
      ids and log-probs per response token, present when the serving backend
      captures them (``capture_topk``). Objectives that compare the rollout
      distribution against another model's use them as the index set.
    * ``extras`` — per-sample channels a method's processor attaches for its
      own loss family to read in ``shape_sample_row``. Nothing shared reads
      them.

    ``rollout_log_probs`` are the ``logπrollout`` behaviour proxy; importance
    ratios ``exp(logπθ - logπrollout)`` are formed from them at train time.
