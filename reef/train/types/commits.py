class PreparedCommit:
    """Trainer-side state of a prepared commit, captured before compaction.

    Everything a durable commit record needs from the trainer: the post-step
    algorithm state, the record high-water mark (how far the store was
    consumed), the rows the step's batch consumed, and the rows the retention
    policy says are now disposable. ``consumed_ids`` and ``compacted_ids``
    answer different questions — a retention policy may keep a consumed row
    stored (audit-only retention), so recovery needs the consumed set on its
    own to know which retained rows must never re-enter a processor.
    Compaction itself is applied separately so the commit record can be made
    durable first. Persisted as a CommitRecord (reef/scenario/commit_log.py);
    the only construction site is Scenario._append_commit_record.

    ``metrics`` is the preparer's step result, carried opaquely: its schema is
    owned by the processor or backend that produced it; the trainer and commit log
    never interpret it, and the harness manifest republishes it verbatim as
    ``gate``. It rides the commit record because that is the only durable
    version-keyed store, so training metrics remain available when the
    resulting version is served.
