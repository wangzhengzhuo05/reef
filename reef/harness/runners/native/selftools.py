"""The self referential tools of the serve form: inspect the harness, try a change on this process, propose it to Reef.

Three built-in tools, built in code and registered only by ``reef-native
serve --self-tools``; the episode form never sees them, so a candidate cannot
win the gate by calling them, and a tree entry cannot take their names. They
run in process whatever ``REEF_NATIVE_ENFORCE`` says, since they are reef's
code and not the tree's. The order a model should use is inspect, then try,
then propose: a trial that helped is one ``harness_propose`` away from the
gate, and nothing a trial does is served to another session or published.
