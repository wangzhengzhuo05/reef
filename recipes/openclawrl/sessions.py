"""Session reconstruction from harness tags or trace matching.

A stable, conversation-unique ``x-reef-tag-session`` value identifies a
conversation directly and binds its turns in arrival order. Without one, a
session is inferred from how each main-turn request's message list relates to
the ones seen before it. :class:`SessionIndex` is the whole mechanism; a
:class:`Binding` is its one product — "a previous turn just received its next
state".

:class:`Stats` is how that mechanism reports on itself. Correlation fails
silently by construction — an unbound turn is simply never judged — so the
counters are the only way the outside can tell "no session ever bound" from
"nothing has arrived yet".

    A request whose canonical message list strictly extends an open
    session's last request — the served reply in the next slot (verified by
    role), then at least one further message — is that session's next turn,
    and its trailing message is the previous turn's next state. A request
    *equal* to a session's last request is a client retry: the first receipt
    keeps the slot. Only the newest turn of a session is ever unbound, so
    the index holds one (receipt, request key) pair per session; an idle
    session's final turn has no next state and never trains — ``expire``
    drops it after the TTL.

    A harness that stamps ``x-reef-tag-session`` skips all of that: the tag
    names the conversation outright, so turns bind in arrival order within it
    and nothing depends on the client resending its transcript. That matters
    for agents that keep history locally or run each turn as a fresh process
    — a Hermes one-shot turn starts from ``[system, user]``, so no cross-turn
    request extends the previous one and the header-free path binds only
    within a turn, never across the user reply that carries the method's
    whole signal.

    Header-free matching has documented limits: ties between canonically
    identical transcripts go to the most recently active session; a client
    that rewrites its own history (compaction, sliding windows) breaks the
    chain and the pre-rewrite turn flushes terminal; an extension carrying
    only the assistant echo (continue-style prefill) binds nothing — a turn
    must never be judged against its own reply.

    Everything here runs on the trainer thread, which must not block
    (``reef/train/processors/base.py``), once per record: the untagged path
    walks the live sessions and the tagged path is a single lookup, and
    ``max_sessions`` is what bounds the first of those.
