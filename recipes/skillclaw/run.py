"""Campaign driver: seven days, six nights, one run per REEF_SC_RUN, on Reef.

Ported from benchmarks/skill_claw/__main__.py at commit 0519eefb (branch
bo/skillclaw-paper), adapted to the harness evolution mechanism. Day one is
the baseline; each night evolves the pool from that day and the next day
measures it, so the last pool never goes unmeasured. The run owns its Reef
service in process: task containers reach it through Docker's host gateway,
every ``/v1`` request they make carries the served pool's catalog
(``SkillClawRecipe``'s surface) and is recorded, and the day's last report
completes the trace batch that schedules the night step. The driver waits for
that background step, then pulls the published pool from ``GET /reef/harness``,
materializes it for the next day's containers, and seals the round. The frozen
control run serves the same way but reports nothing, so nothing batches, no
night runs, and its pool never changes.

A grader failure reports the unscored sentinel (-1.0; 0.0 would be a real
failing grade) and stays out of the category means; the night's judge
backfills the score. A task with no traffic records the fact so the day
still counts every task. Rounds checkpoint as round-<n>/summary.json and a
rerun resumes after the last one: a completed task's stored verdict is never
re-bought, a replayed report that the store already holds is skipped on its
409, a night whose trigger report landed before a crash is poked by hand,
and the served pool survives restarts as pool-current with the commit log as
the authority (_committed_pool).

``python3 run.py report`` prints the gain table over both runs' sealed
rounds (``stats.py``, the preregistered criterion).
``PYTHONPATH=../.. python3 run.py solve`` runs the bundled ``harbor/`` task
once through reef-eval instead - the sibling examples' smoke idiom - against
the same embedded service. The repository root on ``PYTHONPATH`` exposes the
cookbook recipe's canonical ``recipes.skillclaw.recipe`` module.
