"""Wire the adapter into a CORAL gateway (optional CORAL dependency).

CORAL's ``GatewayManager.start()`` builds ``CoralGatewayMiddleware`` around
LiteLLM's app and hands the result to uvicorn. This module splices the reef
layer into that middleware's inner ``app`` reference:

    uvicorn -> CoralGatewayMiddleware -> ReefGatewayMiddleware -> LiteLLM

CORAL stamps ``x-coral-agent-id``/``x-coral-session-id`` first, then the
reef layer translates them to reef headers, so the adapter never needs
CORAL's key registry. The outer middleware object is left in place —
``GatewayManager.register_agent`` type-checks it, so replacing it would
break agent registration. Requires only that reef is one of the LiteLLM
upstreams (an ``api_base`` pointing at ``reef serve``).

Two entry points, both duck-typed so this module never imports CORAL:

- :func:`attach_reef_adapter` for a ``GatewayManager`` the caller builds
  and starts itself.
- :func:`attach_reef_adapter_to_agent_manager` for CORAL's ``AgentManager``
  orchestration (``coral start`` semantics), which constructs its gateway
  internally during ``start_all()``. The splice lands right after the
  gateway starts and before any agent spawns, so no traffic is missed.

CORAL's gateway grew a ``header_provider`` hook (its ``GatewayManager``
accepts a request-header callback), but the reef layer also mirrors headers
into the JSON body and captures reef's response receipts into the journal —
both outside a request-header hook's reach — so the splice stays.

Written against CORAL commit 0123dfb; the touched surface is the documented
middleware's ``app`` attribute and the manager's gateway-start step.
