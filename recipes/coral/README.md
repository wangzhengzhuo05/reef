# CORAL test-time training through Reef and Slime

Runs a real CORAL task with fully attributable inference: CORAL's own runtime
(agent worktrees, gateway, grader daemon) drives coding-agent CLIs whose every
call flows through Reef, evaluator scores return as training data, weights
update, and later attempts serve from the new revision. Implements
[issue #3](https://github.com/Human-Agent-Society/reef/issues/3).

Pinned upstream: [CORAL](https://github.com/Human-Agent-Society/CORAL) commit `0123dfb`.

## Quickstart (2 GPUs)

```bash
cd recipes/coral/examples/coral_demo
pip install -e .[coral]        # demo deps + CORAL at the pinned commit
npm install -g opencode-ai     # or any CORAL runtime CLI; select with --runtime
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` boots the Reef training stack (`serve.yaml`: `CoralRecipe`, Qwen3-8B
LoRA), then `run.py` builds CORAL's `AgentManager` from the real task in
`task/` — CORAL spawns its agent runtimes over `task/seed`, starts its LiteLLM
gateway from `task/litellm_config.yaml` (whose only upstream is the Reef
service), and grades `coral eval` submissions with the packaged grader in
`task/grader`. The reef correlation layer is spliced under the gateway before
any agent spawns; an attempt watcher reports every finalized attempt to Reef
for training. The run auto-stops at its attempt budget
(`--max-attempts`) and writes `work/coral-demo/bundle.json`.

The adapter tests need neither GPU nor CORAL: `python -m pytest tests/test_coral_*.py`.

## Verifying without GPUs

`examples/coral_demo/smoke/run_smoke.sh` runs `run.py` unmodified against the
production Reef service with a canned inference backend
(`smoke/echo_reef_service.py`) and a scriptable CORAL runtime
(`smoke/scripted_runtime.py`). Every wire interaction — worktrees, gateway
key swap, header stamping, receipt capture into the journal, grader-daemon
scoring in the grader venv, exactly-once reporting, the result bundle — is
the real code path; only the model's answers and the agent's "intelligence"
are canned. `coral validate task/` separately proves the task package is a
well-formed CORAL task.

## How the pieces line up

```
CORAL AgentManager (real runtime: worktrees, agent CLIs, per-agent proxy keys,
   |               grader daemon, heartbeats, restarts, attempt budget)
   v
CORAL gateway (identity: x-coral-agent-id, x-coral-session-id)
   v
recipes.coral.middleware      stamps x-reef-scenario + x-reef-tag-coral-{run,agent,commit},
   v                          captures reef receipts -> journal
LiteLLM -> reef serve         stores INFERENCE records with tags,
   v                          answers with x-reef-agent-record-id / receipt SSE frame
CORAL grader daemon finalizes the attempt (.coral/**/attempts/*.json)
   -> recipes.coral.watcher: resolves the attempt's captured references,
      POST /reef/report {score, references, metadata.coral}, exactly once
   -> CoralProcessor groups siblings of one parent commit -> Slime LoRA step
   -> new revision served to the next attempts
```

One discovery problem is one reef scenario; agent and worktree identity live in
tags, so parallel agents share the evolving policy without fragmenting the
scenario.

## Correlation model

The `coral-agent`/`coral-commit` tags reef stores with each INFERENCE record
are the primary correlation key and survive any proxy behavior. The journal
additionally captures reef's response receipts, so reports reference exact
record ids; a stripped receipt degrades to tag-only correlation and is never
fatal. Reports carry a deterministic client-supplied id, so a reporter retry
or crash-replay dedups server-side.

CORAL's gateway stamps each call with the worktree's HEAD at call time — the
*parent* commit the agent was editing, not the commit `coral eval` creates
afterwards. The watcher therefore resolves an attempt's references at the
(agent, parent) coordinate, claiming journal records in order so consecutive
attempts from the same parent (a revert, a retried eval) never share a
reference.

## What gets reported

Real attempts, in their first terminal state, exactly once. CORAL's
`grader_error` attempts (the eval machinery broke, no policy signal) and
`tune` attempts (config sweeps CORAL itself excludes from budgets) are
skipped; archived attempts are ignored.

## The task

`task/` is an ordinary CORAL task — `coral validate task/` accepts it. The
demo problem (implement a stable two-list merge, scored by fraction of checks
passed) is deliberately small so the loop turns over quickly on a 2-GPU
serving stack; swap in any CORAL task by editing `task/` — the wiring does not
change. `task/litellm_config.yaml` is the one reef-specific piece: the
gateway's only upstream is the Reef service, so the served policy is the
agents' only model.

## Known limitations

- `attach_reef_adapter_to_agent_manager` splices under the middleware CORAL's
  manager builds internally. CORAL's gateway now exposes a `header_provider`
  hook, but the reef layer also mirrors headers into request bodies and
  captures response receipts — outside a request-header hook's reach — so the
  splice stays until CORAL grows a response-side hook.
- LiteLLM builds a fresh upstream request, so the middleware mirrors the
  scenario and tags into the body's `extra_headers`; receipt headers are
  matched by suffix because a forwarding proxy prefixes them. Both behaviors
  came out of live GPU runs.
- The demo defaults to the `opencode` runtime; any runtime CLI CORAL registers
  works (`--runtime claude_code`, `codex`, ...), but the CLI must be installed
  and must accept an OpenAI-compatible gateway endpoint for a locally served
  model.
