# TTT-Discover on Reef

This example implements the harness side of
[Learning to Discover at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175). Its
code is intentionally split so the Reef integration is visible and removable:

The [TTT-Discover guide](../../../../docs/user-guide/recipes/tttd.rst) explains the runtime
sequence, a reduced smoke, trajectory configuration, and recovery behavior. This
README records the example's implementation details, paper fidelity, and completed
reproduction results.

## The ordinary harness

`TTTDiscoverHarness` accepts the model call that an ordinary harness already
has. Evaluation stays local:

```python
from recipes.tttd.examples.tttd import TTTDiscoverHarness

harness = TTTDiscoverHarness(call_model, MyProblem(), "task instruction", model="my-model")
best = harness.run(steps=50)
```

Its single-rollout path is:

```python
response = self.generate(self._request_payload(parent))
return self._evaluate_response(parent, response)
```

There is no report hook, transport protocol, receipt wrapper, or other
Reef-shaped abstraction in the ordinary harness.

## The changes needed for Reef

Use the concrete Reef harness instead:

```python
from reef_client import ReefClient
from recipes.tttd.examples.tttd import ReefTTTDiscoverHarness

harness = ReefTTTDiscoverHarness(
    ReefClient("http://reef-host:8900", token="secret"),
    MyProblem(),
    "task instruction",
    scenario="my-single-discovery-problem",
    recipe="tttd",
    release_id="checkpoint-v42",  # optional starting checkpoint
    model="reef",
)
best = harness.run(steps=50)
```

`ReefTTTDiscoverHarness` reuses the request construction, evaluation, archive,
and PUCT mechanics. Its overridden `_rollout` method contains the four actual
integration changes in one place:

1. Send inference through a scenario-scoped Reef endpoint.
2. Retain the returned `agent_record_id` as the generation receipt.
3. After the existing evaluator computes a reward, send a Reef report that
   references that exact inference receipt.
4. Include the rollout group's `comparison_set` so the scenario processor can
   construct grouped training data.

The ordinary harness and problem do not import `ReefClient`, know the scenario
name, retain inference IDs, or construct Reef report payloads.

The runtime flow is:

```text
PUCT chooses G parents
  -> harness submits G × R OpenAI-compatible chat requests
  -> the TTTD inference backend renders each prompt once and calls SGLang /generate
  -> Reef stores exact tokens, response loss mask, and rollout log-probabilities
  -> sandbox executes each generated program; the official verifier gives rewards
  -> harness reports every reward against its exact inference receipt
  -> TTTDProcessor waits for the complete G × R step and removes constant groups
  -> Slime prepares adaptive-beta entropic leave-one-out advantages from the reserved batch
  -> Slime applies frozen-base token KL and un-clipped importance sampling
  -> Megatron performs one optimizer step and synchronizes weights to SGLang
  -> valid children update the local PUCT archive
  -> the Harbor controller waits for the durable scenario commit and new runtime load ID
  -> the post-step PUCT archive is atomically paired with that committed version
```

## Included paper problems

`harbor/erdos_min_overlap/environment/score.py` adapts the
[official Erdős minimum-overlap environment](https://github.com/test-time-training/discover/tree/main/examples/erdos_min_overlap),
one of the paper's mathematics tasks. It keeps the same:

- step-function representation using samples over `[0, 2]`;
- constraints `0 ≤ h[i] ≤ 1` and `sum(h) = n/2`;
- full-correlation calculation of the upper bound `C₅`;
- continuous reward `1 / (1e-8 + C₅)`.

As in the reference implementation, the model writes a Python search program
whose `run()` function returns `(h_values, c5_bound, n_points)`. The program is
run in a subprocess with a wall-clock timeout, CPU/thread limits, network
access governed by the deployment, and an isolated temporary working
directory. The task prompt, seed construction, program contract, normalization
semantics, verifier, continuous reward, and PUCT search value are ported from
[`test-time-training/discover@6c40e82`](https://github.com/test-time-training/discover/tree/6c40e82dab9d5de7416ac873ad5cd3106084aaed).

Acknowledgement: this task is adapted from the MIT-licensed TTT-Discover
implementation by Mert Yuksekgonul and collaborators. Full attribution and
license terms are included below.

`harbor/circle_packing_26/` and `harbor/circle_packing_32/` adapt the two
circle-packing tasks from the same paper. In each task, the model writes
`run_packing()`, which returns circle centers, radii, and a reported sum. The
judge independently requires the selected number of circles, checks square
boundaries and pairwise non-overlap, rejects non-finite values, and computes
the reward directly as `sum(radii)`. The reported sum is never trusted. Both
task prompts preserve their corresponding initial TTT-Discover prompt byte for
byte.

## Setup (once)

```bash
git submodule update --init third_party/reef-client
pip install -e ./third_party/reef-client
pip install -e .
```

```bash
./run.sh
```

That runs `harbor/erdos_min_overlap` on the paper grid: 8 groups of 64
rollouts, one optimizer step, thinking enabled, two GPUs. Nothing has to be
exported first except `TTTD_TASK` — `run.py`, `harness/harbor_agent.py`, and
`serve.yaml` each write out the values they use.

Reef starts and stops the shared Ray runtime automatically; no `ray start`
or fixed Ray port is needed. `run.sh` defaults the local cluster's GPU pool to
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1`; override it at launch to choose different GPUs.
`training.num_gpus` still sets Slime's model topology. To use an existing
cluster, set `RAY_ADDRESS`; its nodes control GPU visibility and Reef leaves
it running on exit. The local Slime driver does not reserve model GPUs itself.

We recommend allocating at least 256 GiB of host memory to the reference
8 × 64 setup. With less memory, reduce evaluator concurrency or request a
larger allocation to avoid stalls or termination.

### Another problem, or a smaller grid

`harbor/circle_packing_26` and `harbor/circle_packing_32` are bundled as well.
`TTTD_TASK` selects one:

```bash
TTTD_TASK=circle_packing_26 ./run.sh
```

`run.sh` gives each task its own scenario and `work/<task>/` state directory,
and sizes the memory limits for it — the packing tasks need a longer context
(`32768`) on the same GPUs, so they get a smaller per-GPU token budget.

The step grid lives in two places and both must agree, or Reef waits for
coordinates the harness never sends: `GROUPS_PER_STEP` and
`ROLLOUTS_PER_GROUP` in `harness/harbor_agent.py`, and `groups_per_step`,
`rollouts_per_group`, and `--global-batch-size` (their product) in
`serve.yaml`. A one-step plumbing smoke sets both sides to 2 x 2 and
`enable_thinking = False`, so a short completion is not spent entirely in the
reasoning channel before it emits a program.

`work/erdos_min_overlap/` holds this problem's checkpoints, artifacts,
scenario records, and PUCT state; a second problem needs its own directory so
the two cannot mix. `work/erdos_min_overlap/tttd-search-state.json` records a
pending archive immediately after a search step and marks it committed only
after Reef's durable training transaction advances the scenario and publishes
a new serving runtime load ID.
Restarting with the same scenario, task instruction, and sampling settings
resumes that paired state; a missing or mismatched step fails closed instead
of silently restarting PUCT against a later model checkpoint. Serving weight
versions are session scoped, so a correctly restored step may rebind the saved
archive to the new engine version.

Use a fresh scenario for each discovery problem: TTT-Discover fine-tunes on one
test problem rather than learning a general task policy.

To add another problem, create a sibling under `harbor/`, write a `score.py`
with a `grade(artifact)` function, and point the values in the table above at
it. The harness scores every generated solution by POSTing it to the task's
judge, so no task-specific imports enter the shared harness.

## Paper fidelity and training ownership

The integration reproduces:

- 8 comparison groups per training step and 64 rollouts per group by default;
  both cardinalities are configurable and the reference setting uses 8 × 64;
- one PUCT-selected initial state shared by each group;
- rank-prior PUCT with maximum-child `Q`, ancestor visit backpropagation, and
  full-lineage diversity blocking;
- the top 2 children per expansion and a top-1000 archive that retains seeds;
- invalid-action reward 0 by default;
- the complete-step barrier and post-barrier removal of constant-reward groups;
- adaptive-beta entropic leave-one-out advantages, using the reference Torch
  float32 bisection procedure;
- frozen-base centered token KL in Slime;
- Tinker's full-batch, token-sum, un-clipped importance-sampling policy loss
  rather than PPO clipping or per-trajectory token averaging;
- Tinker's sampling defaults (`temperature=1`, `top_p=1`, `top_k=-1`)
  explicitly, rather than SGLang's model-specific defaults;
- the reference Adam settings (`lr=4e-5`, betas `0.9/0.95`, `eps=1e-8`,
  zero weight decay, and no gradient clipping);
- raw continuous rewards linked to exact inference tensors rather than
  reconstructed from ordinary HTTP chat JSON;
- Megatron Bridge LoRA with the paper configuration (`rank=32`, `alpha=32`)
  on QKV, attention output, and both MLP projections. The base parameters remain
  frozen in both runtimes. Reef synchronizes the serving-native `lora_A` and
  `lora_B` adapter tensors to SGLang.

The default HTTP backend cannot manufacture training tensors from response
text. The deployment therefore selects Reef's token-native SGLang chat
backend. The public harness route remains `/v1/chat/completions`; inside the
inference backend, Reef renders the prompt once, calls SGLang `/generate`, and
records the engine's sampled token IDs and rollout log-probabilities. Reef's
weight surface names the scenario's own adapter revision on every request;
the harness never selects one and the backend never injects a fallback.

New Slime configs should use the
`recipes.tttd.slime.objective.*` custom-function paths.
The former `reef_adapters.tttd.*` paths
were removed; existing deployment configs must migrate to the backend-owned
module path.

## Earlier Erdős 50-step experiment

We ran a result-level reproduction of the Qwen3-8B Erdős experiment from
[Learning to Discover at Test Time](https://test-time-training.github.io/discover.pdf).
The run used 50 optimizer steps, Qwen3-8B thinking, the two-phase completion
policy, a 26,000-token phase-one budget, the grouped entropic objective,
rank-32 LoRA, and the paper's Adam learning rate. It used eight groups of 32
rollouts on one four-B200 node. The paper's experiment used 64 rollouts per
group, so this run used half of its rollout budget.

### Setup

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Task | Erdős minimum-overlap program discovery |
| Model | `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`, thinking enabled |
| Runtime | Reef, Slime, Megatron, and SGLang LoRA serving |
| Hardware | `4 × NVIDIA B200`, using TP2 × DP2 |
| Search grid | 8 groups × 32 rollouts |
| Training | 50 steps, LoRA rank and alpha 32, Adam learning rate `4e-5` |
| Sequence policy | 30,000-token window, 26,000-token phase-one budget, and two-phase completion |
| Evaluation | 1,000-second program budget and 1,100-second timeout |
| Checkpointing | One checkpoint per step, retaining the latest checkpoint |

### Results

| Completed steps | Runtime | Best certified C₅ upper bound | Best reward |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50/50 | approximately 22.6 hours | `0.380916` | `2.625249` |

Table 2 of the paper reports `0.380932` for TTT-Discover with Qwen3-8B on the
same Erdős task. The verifier minimizes this bound. Search outcomes depend on
sampling, so the two numbers describe separate trajectories with different
rollout counts.

## Formal 8x64 results

The three trajectories used `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` with thinking enabled on two NVIDIA
B200 GPUs. Each search step contained eight groups of 64 rollouts, followed by
one rank-32 LoRA update. Each task has one trajectory, so these results do not
estimate variance across seeds.

### Erdős minimum overlap

| Steps shown | Certified result | TTT-Discover | Target |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 25 | `0.38094` | `0.38093` | `0.38080` |

The certified result is the `C₅` upper bound, so lower values are better. The
curve uses the first 25 committed archive states.

### Packing 26

| Steps shown | Certified result | TTT-Discover | Target |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 | `2.635983` | `2.635983` | `2.636` |

The certified result is the verified sum of radii, so higher values are better.

### Packing 32

| Steps shown | Certified result | TTT-Discover | Target |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 | `2.939573` | `2.939572` | `2.940` |

The certified result is the verified sum of radii. It differs from the value
reported by TTT-Discover by less than `8e-7`.

### Circle-packing configurations and training metrics

The final programs were executed again before their configurations were
plotted. The replay checked the circle count, finite values, square boundaries,
and pairwise non-overlap.

![Verified circle-packing configurations](results/formal-8x64-v3-packing/packing_configurations.png)

W&B recorded 50 committed rows for each packing task. The mean rollout reward
reached its maximum at step 18 for Packing 26 and step 17 for Packing 32. The
best archived Packing 26 result was found at iteration 13. Packing 32 reached
`2.9395727712072386` at iteration 18 and its final value at iteration 24. The
last change was about `2.5e-13`. Sampled-policy KL increased from about `0.0006`
at step 20 to `0.0491` for Packing 26 and `0.0430` for Packing 32 at step 50.

![W&B metrics from the two packing runs](results/formal-8x64-v3-packing/wandb_training_metrics.png)

New runs also record the grid reward distribution and constant-group filtering
counts under the `tttd` W&B namespace. Each `tttd_step_committed` event includes
the archive size and best reward. These fields were added after the two formal
packing runs and are not present in their stored W&B history.

The [circle-packing overview](results/formal-8x64-v3-packing/README.md) contains
the combined W&B history, verified configurations, generated programs,
milestone summaries, and records of how the results were produced.
