"""The continual-learning loop, written out.

For each task, in order:

    solve  — reef-eval runs the task under our agent (six attempts, each an
             inference through Reef)
    verify — Harbor's isolated verifier scores every attempt
    learn  — the agent reports each score against its receipt; Reef's SAO
             recipe trains on the rollouts, and the *next* task is served
             by the updated weights

The ordering is the experiment: task N+1 measures what task N taught. That
only holds if task N's rollouts have actually trained before task N+1
starts, so after each episode the loop blocks until the scenario's version
chain carries one ``training`` release per scored rollout so far. Rollouts
are quick at this model size while a train step also saves a checkpoint and
publishes weights; without the barrier the episode loop finishes ahead of
training and the process exit tears the stack down over a queue of
never-trained rollouts.
