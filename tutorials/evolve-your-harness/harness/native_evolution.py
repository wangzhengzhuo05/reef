"""The method on reef's native harness: the loop's own tools, hooks, graph and agents are nodes the model may mutate.

``propose`` is the self proposer of ``evolution.py`` with a wider vocabulary:
one mutation on a skill, a ``native_tool`` (a schema plus a module defining
``run(args, workdir) -> str``), a ``native_hook`` (a module defining
``listen(payload, next) -> decision`` at one loop event), a ``native_agent``
(a helper with its own prompt, tools and budget that a graph's subagent stage
calls; the proposal then also carries the graph edit that reaches it) or the
``native_graph`` that is the loop's own control flow. ``evaluate`` reads
the native-jsonl trajectory. The grader and the answer table are shared with
``evolution.py``, so ``run.py`` scores recorded traffic the same way for
both variants.
