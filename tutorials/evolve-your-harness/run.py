"""The harness evolution loop, in the open.

One pass on pi (``./run.sh``):

    record - each task goes once through reef inference, so reef serves the
             reply and records the exchange against a receipt
    report - the reply is graded with the same grader the evolve gate uses
             and the score is reported against the receipt; every failure
             (score 0.0, inside the max_score window) batches and triggers
             one gated evolve step - the model proposes a mutation over its
             own failures, real episodes score it, a win publishes
    pull   - GET /reef/harness returns the winning composition; the evolved
             skill, tool, hook, and graph files are printed

On reef's native harness (``./run.sh native``) the same pass runs through a
resident ``reef-native serve`` process, so the publish lands in a process
that is already running:

    pull   - ``python3 run.py pull`` writes the served seed tree under
             work/tree with the model binding at this Reef; run.sh then
             starts ``reef-native serve`` on it, following the head
    turns  - ``python3 run.py native`` sends each task to the process as one
             turn, grades the reply, and reports the score through the
             wrapper's ``report`` command, which claims the turn's receipts
    mount  - the failing report batches and triggers the evolve step; the
             winning tree publishes and the process mounts it while it runs,
             which its log shows as ``harness/mount``
    again  - the first task goes to the same process once more, and the
             new session shows the stages of the mounted graph

Start this through ./run.sh: it writes work/tasks.json and starts the Reef
these constants point at, on pi (serve.yaml) or on reef's native harness
(./run.sh native, serve-native.yaml).
