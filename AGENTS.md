# Agent Instructions for Reef

These instructions apply to AI-assisted work in `Human-Agent-Society/reef`.
`AGENTS.md` is the shared source of truth; `CLAUDE.md` is a relative symlink to
this file. Edit this file when updating shared instructions.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for project policy. Follow any more
specific `AGENTS.md` in the area you change. Explicit user instructions take
precedence over repository guidance.

## Contribution workflow

- Inspect the working tree before editing and preserve existing user changes.
  Keep each change focused on the requested problem.
- Before opening an issue or pull request, search existing issues and PRs for
  overlapping work. Follow the RFC criteria in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for changes to
  architecture, public contracts, persistence, or project policy.
- Reproduce bugs and inspect the relevant implementation before changing it.
  Avoid speculative fixes, unrelated formatting, and unnecessary abstractions.
- Use [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
  Explain the problem, resulting behavior, compatibility impact, and actual
  verification results. Disclose non-trivial AI assistance. The human
  contributor remains responsible for reviewing and understanding the change.
- Keep credentials and private transcripts out of logs, fixtures, and commits.
  Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

## Codebase and boundaries

Reef connects inference, feedback, learning, and versioned delivery for model
weights and agent harnesses. The distribution is `reef-infra`; imports use
`reef`. Use the [codebase map](docs/contributing/codebase-structure.rst) and the
affected package's `__init__.py` docstring to find the owner of a change.

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `reef/core/` | Shared value types, wire contracts, and errors |
| `reef/dispatcher.py`, `reef/scenario/` | Coordination, scenario state, commit ordering, and recovery |
| `reef/service/` | HTTP, authentication, streaming, and deployment |
| `reef/recipe/`, `reef/train/` | Recipe contracts, processors, training, evaluation, and backend integrations |
| `reef/runtime/`, `reef/surface/` | Runtime contracts and delivery of published artifacts |
| `reef/artifact/`, `reef/records.py` | Versioned artifacts, interaction records, and feedback |
| `reef/harness/` | Harness adapters, rendering, runners, and trajectories |
| `recipes/`, `tutorials/` | Method implementations, runnable examples, and tutorials |
| `tests/`, `docs/`, `docker/` | Verification, documentation, and deployment environments |

- Keep shared mechanisms in `reef/` and method-specific policy in `recipes/`.
  The core must not import cookbook methods; `recipes/` does not ship in the
  Reef wheel.
- Keep `reef-client` a separate, dependency-free protocol client. Harnesses
  consume `reef_client`; they should not need Reef's service or training stack.
- Keep the base installation usable on CPU. GPU dependencies belong to the
  supported training environment, and concrete adapters belong under their
  integration. Declare or pin third-party dependencies instead of copying them.
- Preserve provider request bodies, scenario isolation, receipt-to-feedback
  linkage, and artifact publication/recovery contracts.

## Development environment

Use `uv` and the repository virtual environment for Python work. Reuse an
existing environment; for a new checkout, the usual setup is:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" -e ./third_party/reef-client
pre-commit install
```

Reef supports Python 3.10 and newer; CI tests 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. Keep source
syntax compatible with 3.10. Git LFS is required for artifact/checkpoint work.

Training-related work may also need:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[slime]"
uv pip install --no-deps --group runtime
```

The `slime` extra supplies Python-side adapter dependencies; the `runtime`
group pins Slime itself. Preserve `--no-deps` so the installation does not
replace the container's CUDA-compatible stack. Follow
[development](docs/contributing/development.rst) and [docker/README.md](docker/README.md)
for the environment required by the selected backend.

## Python style and design

- Follow `pyproject.toml`: Black and isort format at 119 columns; Ruff checks
  code and naming; mypy checks `reef`. Match nearby code and add types to new
  or changed interfaces.
- Prefer focused functions, data classes for values, and cohesive objects for
  state and lifecycle. Use composition and named protocols for behavior.
- Do not use `TYPE_CHECKING`. Fix dependency direction or move shared contracts
  so annotation imports work at runtime.
- Do not model long-lived behavior as `Callable` constructor arguments,
  callable-valued fields, or callback containers. Use an explicit interface. Keep unavoidable
  third-party dynamic behavior local to its boundary adapter.
- Do not use `assert` or `del` statements in `reef/`; use explicit validation,
  exceptions, and mutation APIs. Test assertions are allowed.
- Use descriptive domain names and short comments that explain intent or
  constraints. Follow the Google-style documentation guidance in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Do not bypass checks by adding broad suppressions or growing
  `.github/python-design-baseline.txt` to accommodate new violations.

## Naming and terminology

Prefer simple, conventional terminology already used in this repository.

Do not introduce abstract or uncommon terminology when a simpler name is sufficient.
In particular, avoid terms such as:

- ledger
- sidecar
- provenance
- evidence

unless the term is already established in the codebase or is the standard technical term for the concept.

Prefer concrete alternatives such as:

- metadata
- manifest
- record
- source information
- checksum
- validation result
- training metadata

When adding new concepts, reuse existing repository vocabulary before inventing new terminology.

## Tests and checks

Start with the smallest existing suite that exercises the changed behavior.
Extend nearby tests and fixtures; check observable results and failure cases.
Public interface changes need contract tests. For training or performance
changes, include relevant evaluation or baseline comparisons.

```bash
# Focused test example; substitute the suite relevant to the change.
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/reef_service/test_reef_artifacts.py -q

# Python checks (activate .venv first for pre-commit's local hooks).
pre-commit run --files path/to/changed_file.py
.venv/bin/python -m mypy

# Full checks before requesting review for Python changes.
pre-commit run --all-files
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/
```

The full suite needs training dependencies even for collection. Some tests
skip unavailable optional runtimes; others import Slime and torch directly.
Use the [testing guide](docs/contributing/testing.rst) and
[CI configuration](.github/workflows/ci.yml) to reproduce the needed environment.
CI uses `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` for
Git LFS test isolation. Record skipped or unavailable checks honestly.

For full-suite coverage on Python 3.12, use
`.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests --cov=reef --cov-report=term`.
The configured coverage floor applies to the whole package, not a focused run.

Pre-commit includes repository-wide Python design, statement, and README
pairing checks even when invoked with `--files`. Review formatter edits and
keep unrelated working-tree changes intact.

## Area-specific guides and documentation

- Before adding a component, read
  [adding-components.rst](docs/contributing/adding-components.rst).
- For recipes and examples, read [recipes/AGENTS.md](recipes/AGENTS.md) and the
  method's README. Keep examples self-contained.
- For harness adapters, read
  [harness-adapters.rst](docs/developer-guide/harness-adapters.rst).
  Golden harness trees under `tests/reef_service/data/harness_goldens/` are
  test fixtures, including their instruction files; preserve exact output.
- For documentation site changes, read [docs/site/AGENTS.md](docs/site/AGENTS.md).
  With Node.js 22, run `npm ci`, `npm run check:docs`, `npm run lint`, and
  `npm run build` from `docs/site/`, matching the docs CI job.
- Keep `README.md` and `README.zh.md` synchronized. After reviewing both, run
  `.venv/bin/python .github/scripts/check_readme_i18n.py --write`, then
  `.venv/bin/python .github/scripts/check_readme_i18n.py`, and include the
  updated `README.i18n.yaml` with the change.
- Update affected API, configuration, and user documentation alongside code.
  Keep this guide concise and link detailed rules to their owning documents.
